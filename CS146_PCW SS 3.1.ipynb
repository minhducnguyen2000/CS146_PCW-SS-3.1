    "Today we explore how samples from a prior distribution can be interpreted as instances of the likelihood function. Specifically, we look at how samples from a normal-inverse-gamma (NIG) distribution can be interpreted as normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short:** Each sample from the NIG distribution is a pair $(x, \\sigma^2)$. These values specify the mean and variance of a normal distribution and so we can think of the sample (the pair of values) as an instance of the normal distribution (which will be our likelihood function). More below.\n",

    "Even though SciPy does have classes defined for the normal distribution (`scipy.stats.norm`) and the inverse-gamma distribution (`scipy.stats.invgamma`), it does not have one defined for the normal-inverse-gamma distribution. To help you, the functions below implement the probability density function and a sampler for the normal-inverse-gamma distribution."
